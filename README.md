# K-Calendar 2.0
<sup>A new version of K-Calendar that uses Javascript, React, Tailwindcss, Mongodb, and NextJS.</sup>

A web application that tracks the releases of future Kpop songs. Not a finished product so there are many unfinished details and bugs. I will be constantly updating.

## General Info
 * All data about artists and their releases are taken from the Spotify API in spotify.js
 * Javascript, React, Tailwindcss, Mongodb, and NextJSare all used to operate the actual web application
 * Cheerio and Axioes are used on Reddit to get the upcoming releases of the month in scrape.js

## Future plans
 * Add News, Rankings, and Artist Information pages to add more uses to the web application
 * Update UI/UX of web app to make it more visually appealing
 * **Much later down the line:** Add a user system, so users can follow artists and track their releases specifically
 
## Developer Note:
I've been mia from my GitHub for the past 1-2 months because I was learning all the technologies to create this. I didn't want to create the repo as I was learning and developing the web app since I didn't want to have a super underdeveloped web app as a repo for 1-2 months. But after a lot of trial and error, I am proud to have this version. There are many bugs, unfinished features, and bad UI/UX practices, but I will try to flush them out. Progress won't be as fast as the past 1-2 months since I now have school. Thank you for using my web app.
